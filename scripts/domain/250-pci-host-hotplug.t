=head1 NAME

domain/250-pci-host-hotplug.t - verify hot plug & unplug of a host PCI device

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The test case validates that it is possible to hotplug a pci
host device to a running domain, and then unplug it again.
This requires that the TCK configuration file have at least
one host PCI device listed.

This first searches for the node device, then detachs it from
the host OS. Next it performs a reset. Then does the hotplug
and unplug, before finally reattaching to the host.
