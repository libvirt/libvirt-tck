=head1 NAME

domain/240-usb-host-hotplug.t - verify hot plug & unplug of a host USB device

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The test case validates that it is possible to hotplug a usb
host device to a running domain, and then unplug it again.
This requires that the TCK configuration file have at least
one host USB device listed.
